\theabstract{
Maps-services providers use vast amounts of geometric data to represent the structures of the world. With increasing amounts of data, the required storage and transmission capacities increase.

Existing compression algorithms can reduce the size of the data at the cost of operability. Namely, any operation requires the entire compressed geometry to be unpacked, resulting in an overhead that may be longer than the operation itself. When performing enormous amounts of operations, such as when validating map fragments, the overhead can be significant.

This thesis aims to create a compression format that reduces the data size of geometries, beyond general-purpose algorithms, while maintaining speed on some specific operations.

The implemented format utilizes delta encoding, a maps-specific coordinate structure, and entropy encoding to reduce the size. In addition, the coordinates are divided into independent blocks, allowing for partial decompression. Partial decompression can be used to avoid decoding irrelevant sections of the geometries. For example, when calculating the \emph{intersection} between two shapes, only the overlapping blocks can contain an intersection point.

{\color{black}During testing, the implementation achieved an average compression factor of 2.56, compared to the WKB standard format. Additionally, with partial decompression enabled, it achieved an average speedup of 3.6 times faster execution when calculating the \textit{intersection} over large geometries, compared to full decompression.} Partial decompression of geometries is largely unexplored in academia, but the results of the thesis indicate that the area may be of interest to investigate further.

% Your abstract should capture, in English, the whole thesis with focus on the problem and solution in 150 words. It should be placed on a separate right-hand page, with an additional \textit{1cm} margin on both left and right. Avoid acronyms, footnotes, and references in the abstract if possible.

% Leave a \textit{2cm} vertical space after the abstract and provide a few keywords relevant for your report. Use five to six words, of which at most two should be from the title.
