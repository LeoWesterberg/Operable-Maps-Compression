ABSTRACT = {In this article, we design and evaluate several algorithms for the computation of the optimal Rice coding parameter. We conjecture that the optimal Rice coding parameter can be bounded and verify this conjecture through numerical experiments using real data. We also describe algorithms that partition the input sequence of data into sub-sequences, such that if each sub-sequence is coded with a different Rice parameter, the overall code length is minimised. An algorithm for finding the optimal partitioning solution for Rice codes is proposed, as well as fast heuristics, based on the understanding of the problem trade-offs.},

The algorithm works with almost any kind of input polygons: concave polygons, polygons with holes, several contours and self-intersecting edges. Important topological information, as the holes of the result polygon, is computed.}
